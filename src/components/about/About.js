            <p>My interest in web development started back in 2023 when I was working for a resort cum summer camp project Even though I had no idea back then on how it worked, those were my first interaction with magic of coding!</p>
            <p>Today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at <a href="https://www.microverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Microverse</a> I've been currently collaborating as <span>Full-Stack Web Developer</span> , with peers from across the globe, each bringing unique cultural perspectives. My primary focus was crafting accessible and inclusive digital products, and continually enhance my skills.</p>
